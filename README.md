# [1TD169] - Data Engineering 1: Spark Lecture

This repository contains supplementary material for the **Apache Spark** lectures in the course **Data Engineering 1 [1TD169]**, offered by the **Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University**.

## Overview
This repository provides resources, guides, and code examples to help students learn and practice Apache Spark concepts covered in the course. It includes instructions for setting up a Spark cluster and a Spark driver VM, as well as notebooks and other materials to support your learning.

---

## Prerequisites
Before using this repository, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Apache Spark and distributed computing.
- Access to a Spark cluster (deployed for the course).
- A Spark driver VM configured for submitting applications.

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Spark Cluster Deployment
A Spark cluster should already be deployed for you. However, if you want to learn how to deploy a cluster yourself, follow the [Spark Cluster Deployment Guide](https://github.com/usamazf/DE1-Spark/blob/main/DE1-2026/guides/spark_cluster_deployment.txt).

### 2. Spark Driver VM Setup
To run the notebooks and submit applications to the Spark cluster, you need to set up your Spark driver VM. Follow the [Spark Driver VM Deployment Instructions](https://github.com/usamazf/DE1-Spark/blob/main/DE1-2026/guides/spark-driver-deploy-instruction.md). Make sure to customize the setup to fit your environment.

## Repository Structure
The repository for course instance **`DE1-2026/`** is organized as follows:
- **`guides/`**: Contains step-by-step instructions for setting up the Spark cluster and driver VM.
- **`examples/`**: Includes Jupyter notebooks with code examples.
- **`data/`**: Sample datasets used in the notebooks.

---

## Usage
Once your Spark driver VM is set up, you can:
1. Access the provided Jupyter notebooks to explore Spark concepts.
2. Submit Spark applications to the cluster using the driver VM.
3. Modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.
